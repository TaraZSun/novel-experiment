# Novel Experiment â€” RAG System Chunking

This project is an **experimental pipeline** for building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using different text chunking strategies.  
It processes long-form text into coherent, self-contained chunks suitable for embedding, indexing, and retrieval.

## Overview
The goal is to evaluate and compare multiple chunking approaches on a sample dataset,  
exploring how chunk size, overlap, and boundaries impact downstream RAG performance.
